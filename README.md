# Pricing the Term Structure with Linear Regressions

This notebook demonstrates a simple and elegant three-step procedure for estimating affine term structure models described by Adrian, Crump and Moench (2013). 

Estimation is contained in PricingTermStructure.ipynb.  Code for loading Nelson-Svensson-Siegel fitted yield curves from the Federal Reserve Board is in load_gsw.py.
